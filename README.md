# ORM research for TypeScript Node.js applications

### Motivation

Research's motivation is provide an global and objective vision about most used ORMs in market. It does not try to define which is the best but instead describes their characteristics, features, performance, and pros and cons.

### What tools are we going to analize?

For this reasearch we are going to consider following ORMs:

#### Knex

[Knex](http://knexjs.org/) is a Query Builder. As it name clames, a query builder is an interface that allows you to writte SQL in your prefered language. Main difference with ORMs is that you don't have to define models strucutre for a query builder because you are not working with objects that represents your data.

Knex supports Postgres, MSSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, Oracle, and Amazon Redshift.

#### Objection

[Objection](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/) has all the benefits of an SQL query builder but also a powerful set of tools for working with relations, for this it can be considered an ORM. It is built on Knex, so supports same databases.

#### Sequelize

[Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) is an ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more. It is one of the most complete ORMs for Node.js.

#### TypeORM

[TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) is an ORM which goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features that help you to develop any kind of application that uses databases.

[[Link to results](#Results)].

#### What is an ORM?

When people talk about ORM, they usually make reference to a library that implements the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) technique\*. It is a completely ordinary library written in your language of choice that encapsulates the code needed to manipulate the data in your database, so you don't use SQL anymore; you interact directly with an interface in the same language you're using.

You can find a great explanation in the following link from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1279613/what-is-an-orm-how-does-it-work-and-how-should-i-use-one).

## Case study

### Database schema

For the research, we created a simple database schema. Many-to-many relation was choosen given it provides us with some
For research purpose we created a simple database schema with a many to many relationship between model orders and items.

<img src="assets/db.png" alt="database schema" width="500" align="left">

```
Table orders {
  id int [pk]
  user string
  date timestamp
}

Table items {
  id int [pk]
  name string
  value float
}

Table order_items {
  order_id int [ref: > orders.id]
  item_id int [ref: > items.id]
}

```

### Endpoints

To tests libraries implementation we created the following endpoints with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).

```
GET /<orm_name>/orders # Get all orders with their items
POST /<orm_name>/orders # Create many orders with their items
```

The key in this endpoints is we are managing nested resources. An order has one or many items, and payload has them nested into order.

## Results

### Community

First, we can look at NPM packages and their metrics to have a clear image about how much they are being used.

In this category, Sequelize seems to be a clear winner. It has been in the game for a longer time and its community doesn't stop growing. It's interesting how Knex is almost as used as Sequelize despite being a less friendly solution. Besides both packages duplicated their weekly downloads in this year.

Objection, in the other side, shows an almost null downloads increase keeping around 50K downloads per week.

Finally, in the last year TypeOrm has triplicated its downloads. Despite staying still well below Sequelize and Knex it is positioning itself as an interesting competitor.

Either Sequelize and Knex provide TypeScript documentation, it is not enough to implement a clean solution in our projects and requires more research.

### Performance

[autocannon](https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon) is a fast HTTP/1.1 benchmarking tool written in Node.js. All examples used are benchmarked using these options:

```bash
# <orm> = knex|typeorm|sequelize|objection

autocannon -c 100 -d 20 -m "GET" "localhost:8080/<orm>/orders"

autocannon -c 100 -d 20 -m "POST" "localhost:8080/<orm>/orders" -i "./data.json" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

- `-c` The number of concurrent connections to use.
- `-d` The number of pipelined requests to use.
- `-m` The method of the requests.
- `-i` File path for request body.
- `-H` Headers definitions.

Test Bench Configuration:

- **OS**: macOs Catalina 10.15.1.
- **CPU**: 2,2 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7.
- **RAM**: 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3.
- **Node version**: v10.17.0.

## Developing

#### Database configuration

Before running the app, make sure you have [Postgresql installed](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-14-04) installed.

You need to create project database manually, to create it run the following steps inside a psql terminal:

1. `CREATE DATABASE db_project_name;`
2. `\c db_project_name`
3. `CREATE ROLE "project_name" LOGIN CREATEDB PASSWORD 'project_name';`

Don't forget to create a dotenv file for environment variables. `Dotenv` is used for managing environment variables. They must be stored in a `/.env` file. File structure is described above:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=project_name
DB_PASSWORD=project_name
DB_NAME=db_project_name
```

#### Migrations

You need to run migrations before start app. To do it simply run `npm run migrate`.

#### Starting app

Run in your terminal: `npm start`.

#### Debugging

In order to debug our Node.js application, we enable 'sourceMap' in `tsconfig.json`, this compiler option generates corresponding `.map` files from original Javascipt counterpart. This change is mandatory to attach a debugger, otherwise it wouldn't be able to match transpiled files with their originals.

In VSCode, you will need to add an `./.vscode/launch.json` file in order to launch the debugger. You can use the following:

```json
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/server.ts",
      "preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "disableOptimisticBPs": true,
      "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Run the tests (`npm test`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
